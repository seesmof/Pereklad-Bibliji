- using XSLT to parse and transform XML to HTML
- using some more advanced technologies like Next.js with React and Tailwind for styling
- on the page add a multibutton box with values like: full, medium, compact; which will set the width of the Bible text
- on the page of course add some way to toggle the toggleable features from [here](./Planning%20out%20the%20XML%20schema.md) on and off
- in JS we can use DomParser to read XML and render it in HTML
- should use OSIS format for the Bible translation, here are the [docs](https://wiki.crosswire.org/Category:OSIS)

- USFM looks very good, most likely gonna be trying to translate using that one
- wanna potentially make some additions to existing modern Ukrainian Bible translations by adding Red Letter, formatting in USFM, adding crossreferences and footntes maybe and open sourcing it
- on BibleGateway the NET translation or the New English Translation has lots of amazingly good translators footnotes
