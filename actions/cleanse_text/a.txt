“Let us draw near with a true heart” (Heb. 10.22). Based on what had been written, this was the heart of the invitation to those in the assembly who had not come to Christ. The same invitation is found in the first New Testament book to be written (James 4.8), where James reveals the corollary of drawing near to God. God will draw near to you. Asaph taught that it is a good thing to draw near to God (Ps. 73.28). The full restoration of Israel to God’s blessing is dependent upon their drawing near to Him (Jer. 30.18–22). In other words, it is an eschatological invitation coming to them in “these last days” (Heb. 1.2). This verse describes the prerequisites for entering the presence of God (Ps. 15). sincerity, security, salvation, and sanctification. The Greek term behind “true” carries the ideas of being sincere, genuine, and without ulterior motive (Jer. 24.7; Matt. 15.8). This one thing these particular Hebrews lacked. genuine commitment to Christ.
